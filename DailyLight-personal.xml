				<heading>If anyone is thirsty, let me quench his thirst.</heading>
				<text>My soul faints with longing for the courts of the LORD.  My heart and flesh cry out for the living God. -Oh God, you are my God, and I will seek you in the morning.  My soul thirsts for you; my flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water, to see your power and your glory manifest as I have seen you in the sanctuary.
				All who are thirsty, come to the waters, and he who has no money, come buy and eat!  Come buy wine and milk without cost! -The Spirit and the bride say "Come!"  And let he who hears say "Come!"  And let him who is thirsty come.  And let anyone who wants to drink freely of the Water of Life. - Whoever drinks of the Water that I give him will find flowing from within himself a spring of water that leads to everlasting life. -In fact, my blood is true drink.
				Eat and drink your fill of love, my friends.</text>
