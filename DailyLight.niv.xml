                <heading version='NIV'>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him.</heading>
                <text version='NIV'>Surely your wrath against men brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restained. -You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good.
                All things are yours, whether -the world or life or death or the present or the future - all are yours, and your are of Christ, and Christ is of God. -All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.  Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.  For our light and momentary troubles are achieving in us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
                Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.  Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</text>
